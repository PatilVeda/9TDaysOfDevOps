#taking input from arguments
arg1=$1
arg2=$2
#printing variables
echo "user input: $name"
echo "argument: $agr1, $arg2"


Enter your name: vedant
user input: vedant
argument: ,








#!/bin/bash


#this is simple file for learning


num1=10
num2=20


if [ $num1 -gt $num2 ];
then
        echo "$num1 is greater than $num2"
elif [ $num1 -lt $num2 ];
then
        echo "$num1 is less than $num2"
else
        echo "$num1 is equal to $num2"

fi

10 is less than 20
